# Sugar

Sugar is a modern open-source forum optimized for performance and usability,
written in Ruby on Rails.

## Dependencies

* [Ruby 2.0+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* [Redis](http://redis.io/)
* [Java](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp)
* libmagic
* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)

## Installation

If you want to hack on Sugar, the easiest way to get up and running is using
Docker Compose:

    $ docker-compose run rails bin/setup
    $ docker-compose up

Sugar is now running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

You can run the tests and linters with:

    $ docker-compose run rails bin/rspec
    $ docker-compose run rails bin/rubocop


## Deploying Sugar

Sugar is deployed like a regular Rails app, see the
[official Rails site](http://rubyonrails.org/deploy). A sample Capistrano
recipe is provided `config/deploy.rb.dist`.

## <a id="configuration"></a> Configuring Sugar

Most of Sugar is configured with a web interface. However, a few details must
be sorted out before the app starts. The defaults should be fine for
development, but you need tweak these settings for production use with
environment variables.

Environment variable  | Required | Info
----------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------
SUGAR_SECRET_KEY_BASE | Yes      | Set to a long, random string
SUGAR_SESSION_KEY     | -        | Default: `_sugar_session`
SUGAR_DB_DATABASE     | -        | Default: `sugar_<%= Rails.env %>`
SUGAR_DB_HOST         | -        | Default: `localhost`
SUGAR_DB_USERNAME     | -        | Default: `rails`
SUGAR_DB_PASSWORD     | -        | Default: ``
S3_BUCKET             | -        | Default: none, set if you want to use S3
S3_KEY_ID             | -        | Default: none, set if you want to use S3
S3_SECRET             | -        | Default: none, set if you want to use S3
SENTRY_DSN            | -        | Default: none, set if you want to use Sentry
